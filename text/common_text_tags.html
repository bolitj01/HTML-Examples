		<p>In his famous <em>I Have A Dream</em> speech, Martin Luther King said:</p>
		<blockquote cite="http://www.mlkonline.net">
			I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in 
			a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin 
			but by the content of their character.
		</blockquote>
